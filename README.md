# Forsch
Toy FORTH clone in C#.

For a riveting demo, assuming you have python installed with Tk support, try piping the output of turtle.forsch to python:

    Forsch.exe < turtle.forsch | python

You should see a field of b e a u t i f u l daffodils grow before your eyes.

C# that interprets forth that outputs python that controls a turtle! It makes me happy.
